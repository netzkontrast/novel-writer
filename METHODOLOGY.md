# Novel-Write Methodology: A Systematic Approach from Idea to Masterpiece

## Introduction: Why Do We Need a Methodology?

Traditional novel writing often relies on inspiration and talent, but professional creation requires a repeatable and verifiable system. Novel-Write introduces the concept of Specification-Driven Development (SDD) from software engineering to establish a comprehensive writing methodology.

This is not about limiting creativity, but about **transforming creativity into excellent work more effectively**.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Specification-Driven Creation
- First, define "what to create," then consider "how to create it."
- The specification is the source of truth; the text is the implementation of the specification.
- Modifying the work means modifying the specification first.

### 2. Progressive Clarification
- Move from a vague idea to a clear specification.
- Eliminate ambiguity through systematic clarification.
- Each step makes the work more defined.

### 3. Verifiable Quality
- Creation is not a mystical art; quality can be verified.
- Ensure the integrity of the work through consistency checks.
- A continuous feedback loop improves the quality of the work.

## The Seven-Step Methodology Framework

```
【Values Layer】    /constitution → Establish non-negotiable creative principles
    ↓
【Requirements Layer】 /specify      → Define what kind of story to create
    ↓
【Decision Layer】   /clarify      → Clarify key creative decisions
    ↓
【Design Layer】     /plan         → Design a plan to implement the requirements
    ↓
【Execution Layer】  /tasks        → Break down the plan into actionable steps
    ↓
【Implementation Layer】/write       → Execute the actual writing
    ↓
【Verification Layer】 /analyze      → Ensure consistency and quality
```

## Detailed Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: `/constitution` - The Writing Constitution

**Purpose**: To establish the core principles and values of the creation.

**Why it's important**:
- Many works deviate from their original intent during the writing process.
- The constitution provides a basis for decision-making when faced with choices.
- It helps in forming a unique personal writing style.

**What it includes**:
- Creative values (what ideas to convey).
- Quality bottom line (standards that will never be compromised).
- Style principles (language, rhythm, atmosphere).
- Reader promise (basic guarantees to the readers).

**Example Principles**:
- "Logical consistency is more important than any cheap thrill."
- "Every character must have a complete motivation chain."
- "Never use knowledge that is out of the historical period."

### Step 2: `/specify` - The Story Specification

**Purpose**: To define the story like a product requirements document.

**Why it's important**:
- To clarify "for whom to write" and "what to write."
- To set measurable success criteria.
- To provide a clear goal for the subsequent creation process.

**What it includes**:
- One-sentence story (elevator pitch).
- Target reader profile.
- Core selling points and differentiation.
- Success criteria (word count, ratings, commercial goals).
- Constraints and risks.

**Special Tags**:
- `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` - Marks points that need further definition.
- `[CORE REQUIREMENT]` - Non-negotiable requirements.
- `[OPTIONAL FEATURE]` - Nice-to-have content.

### Step 3: `/clarify` - Key Clarifications

**Purpose**: To eliminate ambiguity in the specification through Q&A.

**Why it's important**:
- Ambiguity can lead to significant rework later.
- Early decisions affect the entire direction of the work.
- Clear decisions improve writing efficiency.

**How it works**:
- The AI identifies ambiguous points in the specification.
- It generates up to 5 key questions.
- Answers are given interactively and directly update the specification.
- Decision history is kept for traceability.

**Typical Questions**:
- "Is the protagonist's core motivation revenge or justice?"
- "Is the story's pacing fast-paced and thrilling or slow-burn and high-quality?"
- "Is the ending a happy one or does it have some regrets?"

### Step 4: `/plan` - The Creative Plan

**Purpose**: To translate the specification into a technical plan.

**Why it's important**:
- To turn abstract requirements into concrete plans.
- To choose appropriate writing methods and structures.
- To design the specific implementation of plot, characters, and world-building.

**What it includes**:
- Choice of writing method (Three-Act Structure, Hero's Journey, etc.).
- Chapter structure design.
- Character relationship network design.
- World-building system construction.
- Timeline and causality chain.
- Foreshadowing and payoff plan.

**Technical Decisions**:
- "Use the seven-point story structure to enhance suspense."
- "Adopt a multi-threaded narrative to show complexity."
- "Use a limited perspective to increase mystery."

### Step 5: `/tasks` - Task Decomposition

**Purpose**: To break down the plan into executable tasks.

**Why it's important**:
- Turns a large goal into small steps, reducing the difficulty of writing.
- Clarifies priorities and dependencies.
- Supports parallel writing to improve efficiency.

**Task Types**:
- Chapter writing tasks.
- Character profile completion.
- World-building setting supplementation.
- Revision and polishing tasks.

**Task Tags**:
- `[P]` - Can be executed in parallel.
- `[DEPENDS ON:X]` - Depends on the completion of task X.
- `[HIGH PRIORITY]` - High-priority task.

### Step 6: `/write` - Execute Writing

**Purpose**: To execute the writing based on the task list.

**Why it's important**:
- Provides a clear path, preventing getting lost.
- Guarantees quality by following established principles.
- Improves efficiency by focusing on the current task.

**Execution Principles**:
- Strictly follow the principles of the constitution.
- Refer to the technical plan.
- Complete the specific tasks from the tasks list.
- Maintain consistency with the specification.

### Step 7: `/analyze` - Comprehensive Verification

**Purpose**: To verify the quality and consistency of the work.

**Why it's important**:
- To find and fix problems early.
- To ensure the internal logic of the work.
- To continuously improve the quality of the work.

**Verification Dimensions**:
- Constitution compliance (does it violate core principles?).
- Specification fulfillment (are the requirements met?).
- Content consistency (plot, timeline, characters).
- Quality standards (does it meet the set standards?).

## Flexible Application

### Application for Projects of Different Scales

**Short Story (10k-30k words)**
```
Simplified process: /specify → /clarify → /write → /analyze
Focus: Clarify the core conflict and turning points.
```

**Novella (100k-200k words)**
```
Standard process: All 7 steps
Focus: Planning and task decomposition.
```

**Long-form Serial (500k+ words)**
