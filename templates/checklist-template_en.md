### Inspection Suggestions

**Specification quality checklist** (for the planning stage):
- Focus on the quality of the document itself, not the implementation details
- The questions raised should be "Is X defined?" rather than "Is X correct?"
- Complete the inspection before writing to avoid rework

**Content verification checklist** (for the writing stage):
- Focus on the alignment of the written content with the plan
- Mark the specific location of the problem (file name, chapter number)
- Check regularly to find and fix problems in time
