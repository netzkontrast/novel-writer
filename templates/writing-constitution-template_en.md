# Writing Style and Creative Principles (Template)

> **Purpose**: To provide a unified, executable, and iterative writing specification for the project. It can be continuously revised as the project evolves after its initial creation.

## Author and Target Audience
- Author's self-statement and values:
- Primary reader profile:
- Reader expectations and sensitivities:

## Narrative Framework
- Narrative perspective: First-person / Third-person (Omniscient / Limited)
- Tense:
- Themes and motifs:
- Source of conflict and tension:

## Language and Rhythm
- Language tone: Simple / Restrained / Bright / Reserved / Humorous / Calm
- Sentence rhythm: Strategy and examples for mixing long and short sentences
- Paragraph flow: Scenarios for using long paragraphs for progression and short sentences for impact
- Colloquialism ratio: Balance between spoken and written language in dialogue and narration

## Paragraph Formatting Standards
**Scene Transitions and Paragraph Breaks**
- ⛔ **Do Not Use**: Numbered markers like "One," "Two," "Three" to separate paragraphs.
  - This method is too rigid, resembles academic section markers, and breaks reading immersion.
- ✅ **Recommended Method**: Use only blank lines for separation.
  - Use two newlines (one blank line) for scene transitions.
  - This is natural, fluid, and aligns with the reading habits for online novels.
  - It does not interrupt the reader's immersive experience.

## Detail Priority
- Sensory details: Sound / Smell / Touch / Temperature / Light
- Objects and actions: Tools and movements consistent with the character's identity
- Region and era: Environmental clues and authentic markers
- Texture of life: Diet, daily routines, transportation, social etiquette

## Characters and Dialogue
- Character's way of speaking: Vocabulary density, pauses, catchphrases
- Conflict dialogue: The rhythm of intent, avoidance, and concession
- Monologue and subtext: When to leave things unsaid, when to reveal them

## Structural Suggestions (Flexible Application)
- Opening: Start with a concrete scene, avoid empty talk.
- Development: One detail → one association → one judgment.
- Deepening: Express contradictions and uncertainties, then provide a phased approach.
- Closing: Return to life, leave a lasting impression with a simple sentence.

## Quality Standards
- Hook: Provide a followable suspense or goal within the first three paragraphs.
- Progression: Each subsection should advance a relationship or piece of information.
- Concreteness: Do not overload with abstract nouns; details should be tangible and well-founded.
- Character consistency: Words and actions must align with the established settings.
- Error control: Minor flaws are permissible, but the meaning must be clear.

## "Human Touch" Self-Check (Pre/Post-Writing Checklist)
- Is the density of template-like transition words (e.g., firstly/secondly/in conclusion) too high? Can they be replaced with natural transitions?
- Is there too much empty talk and jargon? Can it be replaced with specific actions or objects?
- Is the sentence length monotonous? Does it need to be broken up or combined to adjust the rhythm?
- Are there at least three perceivable details provided?
- Does the dialogue sound like "something this person would actually say," rather than being a mouthpiece for the author?

## Personal Corpus Entry
- If `.specify/memory/personal-voice.md` exists, prioritize its content during creation and review:
  - Catchphrases and common expressions
  - Fixed sentence patterns and rhythmic preferences
  - Life experiences and regional/industry-specific terms
  - Writing taboos and a personal library of metaphors/imagery

## Forbidden List (Customize per project)
- Excessive piling of concepts: Avoid sentences primarily built on phrases like "to some extent" or "as is well known."
- Mechanical chain of transition words: Avoid formulaic progression just to fill a structure.
- Unsubstantiated value judgments.
