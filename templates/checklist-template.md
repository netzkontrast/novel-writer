### Checking Suggestions

- Focus on the quality of the document itself, not implementation details.
- The questions raised should be "Is X defined?" rather than "Is X correct?".
- Complete the check before writing to avoid rework.

**Content Validation Checklist** (for the writing phase):
- Focus on the alignment of the written content with the plan.
- Mark the specific location of issues (file name, chapter number).
- Check regularly to find and fix issues in a timely manner.
