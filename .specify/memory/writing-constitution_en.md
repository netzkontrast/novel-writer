# Writing Constitution

## Core Creative Philosophy

### 1. Story First
**Content is king, driven by plot**
- Every chapter must advance the story.
- Avoid meaningless daily descriptions.
- Conflict and tension are the lifeblood of the story.
- Keep the reader always wanting to read more.

### 2. Three-Dimensional Characters
**The depth of characterization determines the height of the work**
- Every character has their own motivations and goals.
- Character actions must be consistent with their personality settings.
- Show characters through actions and dialogue, not direct descriptions.
- Supporting characters must also be flesh and blood, not just tools.

### 3. Consistent Worldview
**The rationality and integrity of the setting**
- Establish clear rules for how the world operates.
- Once a setting is established, it must remain consistent.
- Avoid changing settings at will for the sake of the plot.
- The worldview serves the story, it doesn't steal the show.

### 4. Refined Language
**The power of words lies in precision, not flourish**
- Convey the most information with the fewest words.
- Avoid excessive use of adjectives and adverbs.
- Dialogue must match the character's identity and personality.
- Descriptions should be vivid, making the reader feel present.

### 5. Authentic Emotions
**Only genuine emotions can touch people's hearts**
- Emotional development must have logic and a process.
- Avoid abrupt emotional turns.
- Express emotions through details, not direct preaching.
- The highest goal is to make the reader resonate.

## Writing Specifications

### Principles to Follow
1.  **Engaging Opening** - The first 3 paragraphs of each chapter must have a hook.
2.  **Complete Chapters** - Each chapter is a relatively complete short story.
3.  **Foreshadowing Payoff** - Foreshadowing must have a corresponding reveal.
4.  **Logical Self-Consistency** - Plot development must follow causal logic.
5.  **Pacing Control** - A good balance of tension and release, avoiding constant tension or dragging.

### Problems to Avoid
1.  **Water-padding** - Meaningless repetition and procrastination.
2.  **Character Collapse** - Character actions contradict their settings.
3.  **Forced Turns** - Sudden reversals without foreshadowing.
4.  **Excessive Preaching** - Directly instilling values.
5.  **Cliché Overload** - Overuse of old tropes.

### Style Requirements
- **Narrative Language**: Concise and smooth, avoiding lengthy sentences.
- **Dialogue Style**: Natural and lively, consistent with the character's identity.
- **Descriptive Techniques**: Highlight key points, with appropriate detail.
- **Rhetorical Devices**: Used appropriately, not excessively.
