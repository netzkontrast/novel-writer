# Creative Principles

## Core Creative Philosophy

### I. Story First
**Content is king, driven by plot**
- Every chapter must advance the story.
- Avoid meaningless descriptions of daily life.
- Conflict and tension are the lifeblood of the story.
- Keep the reader always wanting to read more.

### II. Three-dimensional Characters
**The depth of characterization determines the height of the work**
- Every character has their own motivations and goals.
- Character actions must be consistent with their personality.
- Show characters through action and dialogue, not direct description.
- Supporting characters should also be fleshed out, not just plot devices.

### III. Consistent World-building
**The rationality and completeness of the setting**
- Establish clear rules for how the world works.
- Once a rule is established, it must remain consistent.
- Avoid changing the setting arbitrarily to fit the plot.
- The world-building serves the story, it doesn't overshadow it.

### IV. Refined Language
**The power of words lies in precision, not flourish**
- Convey the most information with the fewest words.
- Avoid overusing adjectives and adverbs.
- Dialogue must fit the character's identity and personality.
- Descriptions should be cinematic, allowing the reader to be immersed.

### V. Authentic Emotions
**Only genuine emotions can move people**
- Emotional development must be logical and gradual.
- Avoid abrupt emotional turns.
- Express emotions through details, not direct preaching.
- The ultimate goal is to create resonance with the reader.

## Writing Guidelines

### Must-Follow Principles
1.  **Engaging Opening** - There must be a hook within the first 3 paragraphs of each chapter.
2.  **Complete Chapters** - Each chapter should be a relatively complete mini-story.
3.  **Foreshadowing Resolution** - All foreshadowing that is set up must be resolved.
4.  **Logical Self-Consistency** - Plot development must follow cause and effect.
5.  **Pacing Control** - The pace should be varied, avoiding constant tension or dragging.

### Problems to Avoid
1.  **Padding** - Meaningless repetition and dragging.
2.  **Character Derailment** - Character actions that contradict their established personality.
3.  **Forced Turning Points** - Sudden reversals without setup.
4.  **Excessive Preaching** - Directly lecturing the reader on values.
5.  **Cliché Overload** - Overusing stale plot devices.

### Stylistic Requirements
- **Narrative Language**: Concise and fluid, avoiding long-winded sentences.
- **Dialogue Style**: Natural and lively, fitting the character's identity.
- **Descriptive Technique**: Emphasize key points, with a good balance of detail.
- **Use of Rhetoric**: Appropriate and not overdone.

### Paragraph Formatting Guidelines
**Scene Transitions and Paragraph Separation**
- **Prohibited**: Using numbers like "One," "Two," "Three" to mark paragraphs.
  - This method is too rigid, like chapter markers in a thesis.
  - It breaks the immersive reading experience of a novel.
- **Recommended**: Use blank lines for separation.
  - Use two newlines (one blank line) for scene transitions.
  - This is natural, fluid, and aligns with web novel reading habits.
  - It does not interrupt the reader's immersive experience.
- **Example**:
  ```
  Li Ming finished packing and turned to leave the room.


  In the kitchen, Xiao Cui was preparing dinner.
  ```
