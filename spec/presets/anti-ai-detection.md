# Anti-AI Detection Writing Guidelines

**Based on Tencent Zhuque empirical testing standards (for cases that passed with 0% AI concentration)**

⚠️ **Important Note**: These guidelines are summarized from cases that actually passed Zhuque detection with 0% AI concentration, abandoning theoretical "compensation methods" in favor of **concise and restrained** natural writing principles.

📚 **Application**: These guidelines are designed specifically for **novel writing**. Writing a novel is fundamentally different from writing an article or blog post:
- **Narrative Cohesion**: Novels require a smooth story flow, avoiding excessive jumps.
- **Punctuation Restraint**: Punctuation in novels is more standardized than in articles, avoiding overly online styles (e.g., `...` with periods, excessive `!!!`).
- **Emotional Tone**: Emotional expression in novels is more subdued, unlike the exaggerated style of blogs.

---

## 1. Core Principles

### ❌ Flawed Philosophy (leads to 95% AI concentration)
The traditional method of "compensating for low temperature" demands:
- Forcibly stacking sensory details ("at least 3 sensory experiences").
- Using ornate metaphors and rhetoric.
- Overly dramatic handling.
- Striving for "vividness" and "richness."

**Result**: These practices actually increase AI characteristics, leading to detection failure.

### ✅ Correct Philosophy (achieves 0% AI concentration)
Based on the principles of natural writing:
- **Restrained Description**: One precise detail is better than three stacked ones.
- **Concise Narration**: Convey information with the fewest words.
- **Short Sentence Rhythm**: Sentences of 15-25 words, with key information in its own paragraph.
- **Plain Drawing (Báimiáo) Technique**: State facts without embellishment (especially suitable for historical settings).

---

## 2. Paragraph Structure Guidelines (Most Critical) ⭐

### 📏 The 30-50% Single-Sentence Paragraph Rule

**Rules**:
- ✅ **30%-50% of paragraphs should be single sentences.**
- ✅ **Keep each paragraph between 50-100 words.**
- ✅ **Put key information in its own paragraph.**

**Example Comparison**:

#### ❌ AI-like Writing (95% AI concentration)
```
A musty smell permeated the room, the only light source being the grayish moonlight filtering through a crack in the curtains. He fumbled along the wall, his fingertips touching the cold stone, until his knee hit the corner of a table—a rickety wooden table covered in a thick layer of dust.
```
**Problems**:
- Too much information in one paragraph.
- Uses high-frequency AI words: "permeated," "the only," "until."
- Excessive description of details.
- Flowery embellishment: "rickety."

#### ✅ Natural Writing (0% AI concentration)
```
After the Yongjia Disturbance, the Central Plains were occupied by foreign tribes.

Most of the Han gentry and commoners, except for a few unwilling to leave their homes, fled south across the river.

Over the years, Wang Qiao had recruited hundreds of refugees to farm for him.
```
**Advantages**:
- Single sentences as separate paragraphs (100% single-sentence paragraphs).
- Concise and restrained, no stacking.
- Historical plain drawing technique.
- Even has colloquial features (a natural language habit).

### 📊 Paragraph Structure Check

After writing a section, check:
- [ ] Is the percentage of single-sentence paragraphs between 30%-50%?
- [ ] Is the word count of each paragraph between 50-100 words?
- [ ] Are there any overly long paragraphs (>150 words)?
- [ ] Is key information in its own paragraph?

## 3. List of Prohibitions (Anti-AI Voice)

### 🚫 1. Prohibit Meaningless Stacking

**Incorrect Example**:
```
❌ He saw three lamps, two tables, and a chair in the room, heard birds chirping outside the window, smelled the smoke in the air...
```

**Correct Approach**:
```
✅ There was an old table in the room.
```

**Principles**:
- ❌ Don't force "3 sensory experiences."
- ❌ Don't list emotions.
- ✅ One precise detail is better than three stacked ones.

### 🚫 2. Prohibit Ornate Metaphors

**Incorrect Example**:
```
❌ The air seemed to freeze.
❌ A rickety wooden table.
❌ A face as pale as death.
```

**Correct Approach**:
```
✅ Silence.
✅ An old wooden table.
✅ A pale face.
```

### 🚫 3. Prohibit Over-dramatization

**Incorrect Example**:
```
❌ Before the words were out of her mouth, she had turned to leave. He rushed forward and grabbed her wrist. She violently shook him off, the force so great she stumbled. They stared at each other for three seconds, the air frozen...
```

**Correct Approach**:
```
✅ She turned and left.

He went after her.
```

### 🚫 4. Prohibit Explanatory Dialogue

**Incorrect Example**:
```
❌ "I am angry because you didn't come yesterday, which made me feel very disappointed."
```

**Correct Approach**:
```
✅ "Where were you yesterday?"
"...None of your business."
"None of my business? Fine!"
```

### 🚫 5. Prohibit Direct Psychological Descriptions

**Incorrect Example**:
```
❌ He thought to himself, this is not simple.
❌ A wave of anger surged within her.
```

**Correct Approach**:
```
✅ His brow furrowed.
✅ She clenched her fists.
```

## 4. AI High-Frequency Word Blacklist

### 🚨 Words to Avoid at All Costs

**Descriptive**:
- ❌ permeated
- ❌ the only
- ❌ rickety
- ❌ as if, like

**Action**:
- ❌ until
- ❌ suddenly
- ❌ before the words were out
- ❌ couldn't help but

**Psychological**:

- ❌ suddenly
- ❌ a wave of... surged within
- ❌ couldn't help but

**State**:
- ❌ the air froze
- ❌ time seemed to stand still

### 🔄 Replacement Strategy Table

| ❌ AI Word | ✅ Natural Replacement |
|---|---|
| a musty smell permeated | had a musty smell / the musty smell was strong |
| the only light source | only a little light / just a bit of light |
| a rickety wooden table | an old wooden table / a broken table |
| he thought to himself | he thought / **delete** |

| couldn't help but sigh | sighed / **delete** |
| the air froze | silence / **delete** |
| as if in a dream | like a dream / **delete** |
| time seemed to stand still | **delete** |

**Note**: In many cases, **deleting** these modifiers is better than replacing them.

## 5. Natural Writing Principles

### 1️⃣ Historical Plain Drawing (Báimiáo) Method (for historical settings)

**Definition**: State facts without embellishment, similar to the style of historical records.

**Example**:
```
✅ After the Yongjia Disturbance, the Central Plains fell. The gentry fled south, and the common people were displaced. Wang Qiao recruited refugees in the south to reclaim and cultivate land.
```

**Characteristics**:
- Concise and direct.
- No emotional coloring.
- High information density without being cumbersome.

### 2️⃣ Colloquial Handling (Dialogue)

**Principle**: Real dialogue contains pauses, errors, and repetitions.

**Example**:
```
✅ "You... what are you doing here?"
"I, I was just... passing by."
"Passing by? Who are you kidding!"
```

**Techniques**:
- Add pauses: "..."
- Allow repetitions: "Yes, yes."
- Allow grammatical errors.
- Use incomplete sentences: "Never mind."

### 3️⃣ Short Sentence Rhythm (Narration)

**Principles**:
- Sentences of 15-25 words.
- Key information in its own paragraph.
- Avoid complex clauses.

**Example Comparison**:

❌ **Long, complex sentence**:
```
He walked into the room, saw a letter on the table, picked it up and opened it, found that it told him to go to the woods outside the city, so he left immediately.
```

✅ **Short, concise sentences**:
```
He walked into the room.

There was a letter on the table.

It said: Go to the woods outside the city.

He left immediately.
```

### 4️⃣ Restrained Description (Scenes)

**Principle**: 1-2 details per scene are enough; don't describe everything.

**Example Comparison**:

❌ **Over-description**:
```
A musty smell permeated the room, the walls were mottled and cold, the light was dim, there was only a broken table and a chair, and the sound of mice could be heard in the air...
```

✅ **Restrained description**:
```
The room was dark. It smelled musty.
```

## 8. Common Error Cases

### Case 1: Forcing Sensory Stacking

**Incorrect Version** (95% AI concentration):
```
He walked into the room, his eyes met with darkness, a damp, musty smell permeated his nostrils, he heard the sound of dripping water, his fingers touched the cold wall, and his tongue tasted the bitterness in the air...
```

**Corrected Version** (expected <5% AI concentration):
```
He walked into the room.

It was dark and smelled musty.

Water was dripping in the corner.
```

### Case 2: Stacking Ornate Metaphors

**Incorrect Version**:
```
Her eyes were like a deep autumn lake, calm with a hint of coldness, as if they could freeze all emotion, yet like the stars in the night sky, distant and unreachable...
```

**Corrected Version**:
```
Her eyes were cold.

He didn't dare to look.
```

### Case 3: Over-dramatization

**Incorrect Version**:
```
Before the words were out of her mouth, she had turned to leave. He rushed forward and grabbed her wrist. She violently shook him off, the force so great she stumbled. They stared at each other for three seconds, the air frozen, until she disappeared down the hall without a backward glance.
```

**Corrected Version**:
```
She turned to leave.

He caught up and grabbed her.

She shook him off.

"Get away from me!"

She ran.
```

## 11. Punctuation Personalization (Advanced De-AI-ification) ⭐

### Core Philosophy

Punctuation is the emotional vehicle of text. AI tends to use neat, standard punctuation, while human writing has **personality, emotion, and "flaws."**

### Key Strategies

#### 1. Ellipsis Diversification (Novel Version)
- ❌ AI: Always the standard 6-dot ellipsis (`……`).
- ✅ Moderate mix for novels:
  - Formal scenes: `……`
  - Colloquial scenes: `...`
  - ~~Casual scenes: `。。。`~~ ⚠️ **Use with caution in novels; this is a blog/chat style.**

**Novel Suggestion**: Mainly mix `……` and `...`, avoid the period-style ellipsis (`。。。`).

#### 2. Emotional Punctuation
- **Hesitation**: Dense ellipses.
  - Example: "He thought... never mind... let's not say it."
- **Excitement**: Multiple exclamation marks.
  - Example: "Great!! We're saved!"
- **Confusion**: Multiple question marks.
  - Example: "What?? How is that possible???"

#### 3. Punctuation and Emotion

| Emotion | Punctuation Feature | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Calm | Standard comma and period | He walked over. |
| Hesitant | Ellipsis, dash | He thought... never mind. |
| Tense | Short sentences, frequent periods | Footsteps. Closer. |
| Excited | Multiple exclamation marks | Great!! |
| Confused | Multiple question marks | What?? How... |

### Quick Self-Check

- [ ] Is only one style of ellipsis used? (AI tendency)
- [ ] Does punctuation change with high emotion?
- [ ] Is the punctuation too neat?
- [ ] Are there punctuation "errors" (colquial, dialect)?

**Detailed Guide**: See `spec/knowledge/punctuation-personality.md`

- `spec/knowledge/natural-expression.md` - Techniques for natural expression.

### Four-Layer Strategy Overview

1.  **Layer 1: Style Imitation** - Don't just be vaguely "natural"; have a specific benchmark.
2.  **Layer 2: Concrete Injection** - Actively acquire real details to replace abstract expressions.
3.  **Layer 3: Punctuation Rebellion** - Break the neatness; punctuation should carry emotion.
4.  **Layer 4: Structural Imbalance** - Intentional imbalance is what makes it real.
