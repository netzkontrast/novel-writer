- "Very messy" → "Messier than a garbage dump"

### Better Without Metaphors

Often, **direct description** > **flowery metaphors**

## Quick Reference Card

```
🎯 Core Principles
- Time should be specific (Last Wednesday > Recently)
- Characters should be clear (Uncle Li > Someone)
- Quantities should be precise (5 > Many)
- Scenes should be visible (Piled with clothes > Messy)

💡 Remember the Formula
[Abstract Word] → [Concrete Detail] + [Feeling/Comparison/Data]

⚠️ Cautions
- Don't over-concretize (becomes a dry list)
- Maintain moderate vagueness (seven or eight, a dozen or so)
- Be precise at key moments (turning points, climax)
- Generalize in secondary parts (transitions, exposition)

✅ Self-Check Questions
- Can you answer "when"?
- Can you answer "who"?
- Can you answer "how many"?
- Can you answer "what is it like"?
