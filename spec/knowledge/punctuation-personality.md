# Punctuation Personalization Guide (for Novel Writing)

> Punctuation is the emotional vehicle of text. Human writing uses punctuation with personality, emotion, and "flaws," whereas AI tends to use neat, standard, and perfect punctuation.

⚠️ **Important Note**: This guide is specifically designed for **novel writing**. Punctuation in novels is more **restrained** than in blog posts or articles, especially in historical fiction.

## 🎯 Punctuation Differences: Novel vs. Article/Blog

### Punctuation Principles for Novel Writing
- ✅ Primarily restrained, not overly emotional.
- ✅ Maintains narrative fluency.
- ✅ Punctuation serves the story, not overshadows it.
- ❌ Avoids excessive use of internet-style punctuation (e.g., `...` using periods, `!!!`, `??`).
- ❌ **Emojis are forbidden** (no emojis are used in novel writing).

### Punctuation Characteristics of Blogs/Articles (Not applicable to novels)
- Can use `...` (period-style ellipsis).
- Can use emojis.
- Punctuation is more exaggerated and emotional.
- More internet-style expressions.

**Core Difference Between Novels and Articles**:
- Novels: ❌ **Emojis are strictly forbidden.**
- Articles: ✅ Emojis can be used.

## 2. The Authenticity of the Ellipsis

### AI Tendency (Avoid)
```
He thought about it...... and decided not to say anything.
```
- Always the standard 6-dot ellipsis.
- Used in limited scenarios.
- Neatly placed.

### Human Variation (Recommended)

**Type 1: Standard Ellipsis (`……`)**
- Use Case: Formal narration, deep thought, unspoken words.
- Example: He was silent for a long time...... and finally sighed.

**Type 2: Three-Dot Ellipsis (`...`)**
- Use Case: Fast pace, colloquial speech, internet style.
- Example: Forget it... you wouldn't understand anyway.

**Type 3: Period-Style Ellipsis (`。。。`)** ⚠️ **Use with caution in novels**
- Use Case: ~~Dialect, casual style, old-fashioned typing habits~~ **This is a blog/chat style, rarely used in formal novels.**
- Applicable: Only for specific characters in modern web novels (e.g., an internet-addicted teen, a quirky persona).
- Example: ~~This thing... how should I put it...~~ **Avoid in novels.**

**Type 4: Mixed Usage (Moderated for Novels)**
- In novels, you can mix the standard ellipsis (`……`) and the three-dot version (`...`).
- However, **avoid using the period-style ellipsis (`。。。`)**.
- Example:
  ```
  He hesitated... no, he was scared.
  "I... I don't know what to say."
  After a long silence...... he finally spoke.
  ```
