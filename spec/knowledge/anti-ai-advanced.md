## Core Philosophy

### The Essence of AI Flavor

**Four Major Characteristics of AI Writing**:
1. **Perfect Writing Style**: Standard vocabulary, neat sentence structures, strict logic.
2. **Lack of Experience**: Many abstract concepts, few concrete details.
3. **Neat Punctuation**: Always correct, standard positioning, no emotional fluctuation.
4. **Balanced Structure**: Similar word count in each paragraph, consistent information density.

**Characteristics of Human Writing**:
1. **Personal Writing Style**: Has preferences, habits, and "mistakes."
2. **Rich Experience**: Concrete details, real data, personal feelings.
3. **Emotional Punctuation**: Varies with emotion, has personality, has "chaos."
4. **Imbalanced Structure**: Has focus, omissions, and jumps.

### Removing AI Flavor Isn't a Technique, It's Restoring Authenticity

Authentic writing has **warmth, deviation, and flaws**. These "imperfections" are, in fact, proof of authenticity.

## Layer 1: Systematizing Writing Style Imitation

### Core Idea: Don't just be vaguely "natural," have a **specific benchmark**

### Four-Dimensional Feature Extraction Method ⭐

When analyzing excellent works with `/book-style`, extract these four dimensions:

#### Dimension 1: Textual Features
- High-frequency vocabulary (verbs, adjectives, adverbs)
- Sentence structure preference (long/short/combination)
- Vocabulary style (classical/modern/web novel)
- Unique expressions (catchphrases, characteristic sentence patterns)

#### Dimension 2: Punctuation Habits ⭐ (Most easily overlooked)
- Ellipsis style (……/.../ 。。。)
- Exclamation mark usage (single!/multiple!!)
- Question mark habits (standard?/multiple??)
- Dash frequency
- Comma density
- **Most Importantly**: Degree of emotional punctuation

#### Dimension 3: Layout Style ⭐ (Key to anti-AI detection)
- Percentage of single-sentence paragraphs (30-50% is best)
- Paragraph length distribution
- Blank line usage habits
- Dialogue paragraphing method

#### Dimension 4: Special Expressions ⭐ (Personality markers)
- ~~Emoji usage~~ ❌ **Emoji usage is forbidden in novel writing**
- Onomatopoeia preference
- Interjection characteristics
- Dialect and slang
- Incomplete sentence structures

### Practical Application Flow

1. **Select a Benchmark**: Find an excellent work with a similar style.
2. **Four-Dimensional Extraction**: Use `/book-style` to analyze and extract the four-dimensional features.
3. **Generate Reference**: Automatically generate `style-reference.md`.
4. **Apply Imitation**: `/write` will automatically reference these features.
5. **Continuous Optimization**: Adjust the degree of imitation based on feedback.

### Benchmark Selection for Different Genres

| Genre | Recommended Benchmark | Core Features |
|---|---|---|
| Ancient History | *A Record of a Mortal's Journey to Immortality* (Wang Yu) | Historical sketches, restrained descriptions, many single-sentence paragraphs |
| Power Struggles | *Joy of Life* (Shi Zhangyu) | Sharp dialogue, exquisite foreshadowing, varied pacing |
| Modern Urban | [Specific Work] | Life details, colloquial language, flexible punctuation |
| Fantasy/Xianxia | [Specific Work] | Concrete data, fast pacing, many exclamation marks |

## Layer 2: Concrete Experience Injection Mechanism

### Core Idea: Actively acquire real details, don't wait passively

### Three-Step Concretization Injection Method

#### Step 1: Identify Abstract Expressions

Actively identify during writing:
- **Time Abstractions**: recently, a long time ago, not long ago
- **Character Abstractions**: someone, everyone, it is said
- **Quantity Abstractions**: many, few, a large amount
- **Scene Abstractions**: very xx, extremely, exceedingly

**Self-Check Questions**:
- Can you answer "when"?
- Can you answer "who"?
- Can you answer "how many"?
- Can you answer "what is it like"?

#### Step 2: Apply Replacement Formulas

Refer to `detail-formulas.md` and use quick replacements:
- "recently" → "last Wednesday afternoon"
- "someone said" → "Uncle Li told me" / "Old Wang next door mentioned"
- "many" → "at least twenty"
- "very messy" → "clothes that haven't been washed for three days are piled on the floor"

#### Step 3: Actively Search for Supplements

**When real details are needed, use WebSearch**:

| Scene | Search Keywords | Content to Obtain |
|---|---|---|
| Historical Background | "[Dynasty] official system" | Real official titles |
| Geographical Information | "[City] characteristic dialect" | Dialect vocabulary |
| Professional Field | "[Industry] professional terms" | Real terminology |
| Cultural Details | "[Decade] popular slang" | Real usage |

### Concretization Hierarchy Principle

**Level 1 - Must Be Concrete**:
- Turning point plots
- Climax scenes
- Foreshadowing
- Key character introductions

**Level 2 - Should Be Concrete**:
- Important dialogues
- Emotional shifts
- Conflict outbreaks

**Level 3 - Can Be Generalized**:
- Transitional paragraphs
- Background exposition
- Passage of time

**Level 4 - No Need to Be Concrete**:
- Common sense content
- Fast-paced scenes
- Intentionally leaving suspense

## Layer 3: Punctuation Rebellion Strategy

### Core Idea: Break the neatness, punctuation should carry emotion

### Three Principles of Punctuation Rebellion

#### Principle 1: Emotion Determines Punctuation

| Emotion | Punctuation Feature | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Calm | Standard comma and period | He walked over. |
| Hesitant | Dense ellipsis | He thought... never mind... let's not talk about it. |
| Tense | Short sentences + periods | Footsteps. Closer and closer. He held his breath. |
| Excited | Multiple exclamation marks | Great!! We're saved! |
| Confused | Multiple question marks | What?? How is this possible??? |
| Angry | Exclamation + ellipsis | You!!!... Get out! |

#### Principle 2: Diverse Mixing (Novel Version)

**Ellipsis**:
- Formal scenes: …… (6 dots)
- Colloquial scenes: ... (3 dots)
- ~~Casual scenes: 。。。 (periods)~~ ⚠️ **Use with caution in novels, this is a blog/chat style**
- **In novels, mainly mix …… and ..., avoid 。。。**

**Exclamation Mark**:
- Regular: !
- Emphasized: !! (Common in novels)
- Explosive: !!! (Use sparingly in novels, 2-3 at most)
- **Choose based on emotional intensity and genre**

#### Principle 3: Break the "Perfection"

**AI Tendency** (Avoid):
- Punctuation is correctly placed in every sentence.
- Commas and periods are used according to textbooks.
- Dialogue punctuation is always standard.

**Human Characteristic** (Recommended):
- Sometimes a period is used where a comma should be (long sentences connected).
- Dialogue punctuation is sometimes "wrong" (colloquial).
- Ellipsis style is inconsistent (habit differences).

### Punctuation Rebellion Self-Checklist

- [ ] Is the punctuation too neat? (AI tendency)
- [ ] Is only one style of ellipsis used?
- [ ] Does punctuation explode during emotional excitement?
- [ ] Are there punctuation "mistakes"? (colloquial, dialect)
- [ ] Do different characters have different punctuation?

## Layer 4: The Art of Structural Imbalance

### Core Idea: Intentional imbalance is what makes it real

### Three Imbalance Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Length Imbalance

**AI Tendency** (Avoid):
```
Paragraph 1: 100 words
Paragraph 2: 95 words
Paragraph 3: 102 words
Paragraph 4: 98 words
```
→ Too uniform, obvious AI characteristic

**Human Characteristic** (Recommended):
```
Paragraph 1: Three words.
Paragraph 2: A 150-word long paragraph, all in one go...
Paragraph 3: A 20-word short sentence.
Paragraph 4: Another long paragraph, pouring out everything to say, interspersed with emotions and details...
```
→ Has focus, pauses, and rhythm

#### Strategy 2: Information Density Imbalance

**AI Tendency** (Avoid):
- Similar amount of information in each paragraph.
- Details are evenly distributed.
- Descriptive intensity is consistent.

**Human Characteristic** (Recommended):
- Key parts: Explosion of details, dense information.
- Transitional parts: Skimmed over, quickly passed.
- White space parts: Intentionally omitted, letting the reader imagine.

#### Strategy 3: Narrative Pacing Variation ⚠️ (Use with caution in novels)

**Explanation**: Novel narratives need to maintain coherence; excessive jumping will affect the reading experience. Use only in specific scenarios.

**AI Tendency** (Avoid):
```
A → B → C → D (Too linear, no rhythm change)
```

**Moderate Novel Version** (Recommended):
```
A → B → [Flashback/Recall] → C → D
```
- Moderate flashback interruptions (not random jumps).
- Associations triggered by emotions (logical connection).
- Keep the main storyline clear (don't actually "go in a circle").

**Note**: This strategy is more suitable for articles/blogs; use with extreme restraint in novels.

### Practical Application: Paragraph Structure Imbalance Method

**Golden Ratio**: 30-50% single-sentence paragraphs (Key to anti-AI detection)

**Example Comparison**:

❌ **AI-like Structure** (Too uniform):
```
He entered the room and saw a letter on the table. The envelope was yellow and looked a bit old. He picked up the letter, opened it, and found it was a suicide note.

He was shocked and couldn't believe it was real. He read it carefully several times to confirm he wasn't mistaken. This made him fall into deep thought.

He decided to investigate the truth of the matter.
```
- Two sentences per paragraph.
- Similar length (50-60 words).
- Consistent information density.

✅ **Human-like Structure** (Moderately imbalanced):
```
The room was dark.

He went in and saw a letter on the table. Yellow envelope, a bit old, the corners were curled up.

He picked it up.

Opened it.

It was a suicide note.

He stared at those words for ten seconds... how is this possible?! The date on the letter was three years ago, exactly when that person disappeared. The handwriting was messy, as if written in extreme panic: "If you are reading this letter, it means I am already..." followed by a patch of ink, illegible.

His hands started to tremble.

This isn't right. Something is very wrong.

He had to find out—no matter the cost.
```
- Single-sentence paragraphs: 7/11 = 64%
- Length imbalance: as short as 4 words, as long as 86 words
- Information density: dense at the discovery of the suicide note, restrained elsewhere
- Pacing variation: short sentences create tension, long sentences build suspense

## Integrated Application of the Four-Layer Strategy

### Practical Comprehensive Case

Scenario: **The protagonist discovers a shocking secret**

#### ❌ AI-like Version (0 points)
```
Recently, he was investigating something. Someone told him that this matter was very complicated and involved many people. He felt very shocked and decided to continue investigating.

He went to a place and saw some things. These things made him more convinced that the matter was far more complicated than he had imagined. He thought to himself, I must find out the truth.

He began to take action.
```
**Problem Diagnosis**:
- Time/character/place are all abstract.
- Punctuation is neat and emotionless.
- Paragraph length is uniform (45/50/8 words).
- Direct psychological description ("He thought to himself").

#### ✅ Human-like Version (Full Marks) - Applying the Four-Layer Strategy

```markdown
Last Wednesday.

Old Wang found him, his voice low: "That thing you asked about last time... I found something out."

"What thing?"

"The fire on Yong'an Street." The old man looked around. "It wasn't an accident."

His heart tightened.

Yong'an Street... that was three years ago. The official conclusion was aging wiring, seventeen people died. His dad was one of them.

"Are you sure?"

"Absolutely." The old man took out a USB drive from his pocket. "The evidence is in here. But—" he paused, "after you see it... there's no turning back."

He stared at the USB drive...

Three years.

Three whole years.

He took the USB drive, his hand trembling: "Thanks, Uncle Wang."

After the old man left, he sat alone in his rented room. The room was quiet, only the sound of music from the KTV downstairs could be heard.

The USB drive was on the table.

Should he watch it?

...no turning back after seeing it.

He took a deep breath and plugged in the USB drive.

There was only one video in the folder.

He clicked on it.

The picture was blurry, like a surveillance video. The date showed: 2022-05-03, 21:47—13 minutes before the fire.

In the video, three men in black entered No. 15 Yong'an Street.

He zoomed in.

The moment one of them turned his head—

He froze completely.

That face... he recognized it!!

It was the district chief's son, Li Mingyang!!!
```

**Four-Layer Strategy Application Analysis**:

**Layer 1 - Writing Style Imitation**:
- Mainly short sentences (sense of tension).
- Crisp dialogue (suspense style).
- High frequency of single-sentence paragraphs (16/25=64%).

**Layer 2 - Concretization Injection**:
- Time: "Last Wednesday," "three years ago," "2022-05-03 21:47."
- Characters: "Old Wang," "the district chief's son, Li Mingyang."
- Places: "Yong'an Street," "rented room," "KTV downstairs."
- Quantities: "seventeen people," "three years," "13 minutes."
- Details: "USB drive," "surveillance video," "men in black."

**Layer 3 - Punctuation Rebellion**:
- Ellipsis: Mixed usage (... and ……).
- Exclamation mark: Multiple (!!).
- Question mark: Self-questioning.
- Dash: Pauses and transitions.
- Emotional punctuation: Explosive at the moment of shock.

**Layer 4 - Structural Imbalance**:
- Paragraph length: as short as 3 words ("Three years."), as long as 45 words (background explanation).
- Information density: dense at the discovery of the truth, restrained elsewhere.
- Single-sentence paragraphs: 64%, well above the 30% baseline.
- Thought jumps: flashback → hesitation → determination.

## Scene Adaptation Solutions

### Ancient History Novels

**Characteristics**: Restraint is primary, imbalance is secondary.

**Four-Layer Strategy Adjustment**:
- Layer 1: Historical sketch style, 40-50% single-sentence paragraphs.
- Layer 2: Moderate concretization (reign title + event).
- Layer 3: Restrained punctuation (few exclamation marks, standard ellipsis).
- Layer 4: Moderate imbalance (mainly in information density).

**Example**:
```
After the Yongjia Disturbance, the Central Plains fell.

No fewer than a million gentry and commoners crossed south.

Wang Qiao recruited refugees, reclaimed wasteland, and planted crops.

After three years, he had a considerable estate.
```
- Single-sentence paragraphs: 100%
- Concretization: reign title, quantity
- Punctuation: standard comma and period
- Imbalance: varied length (9-16 characters)

### Modern Urban Novels

**Characteristics**: High flexibility, all four layers of the strategy are fully engaged.

**Four-Layer Strategy Adjustment**:
- Layer 1: Colloquial style, 30-40% single-sentence paragraphs.
- Layer 2: High degree of concretization (brands, prices, place names).
- Layer 3: Free punctuation (mixed ellipsis, multiple exclamation marks).
- Layer 4: Obvious imbalance (large span in length).

**Example**:
```
The taxi driver couldn't find the way, circled the World Trade Center three times.

"Sir, are you using GPS?"

"I am, I am... this road isn't right..."

He glanced at his phone.

18:45.

It's over.

The interview started at 18:00, he's definitely late now. The traffic is this bad, conservatively another twenty minutes.

Maybe... make a call to explain?

He opened his contacts, found "HR Miss Zhang."

Hesitated for ten seconds.

Forget it, being late for the first impression, nothing he says will help.

He sighed and leaned back in his seat.

This was the 17th resume he had sent out this month, finally got a response... and it's gone just like that.

"Sir, I'm not going anymore, let's go back."
```

### Fantasy/Xianxia Novels

**Characteristics**: Data-intensive, explosive punctuation.

**Four-Layer Strategy Adjustment**:
- Layer 1: Concise and powerful, 30-35% single-sentence paragraphs.
- Layer 2: Data concretization (realms, spirit stones, elixirs).
- Layer 3: Exaggerated punctuation (3-5 exclamation marks are acceptable).
- Layer 4: Imbalanced pacing (dense combat, concise elsewhere).

**Example**:
```
"Boom!"

A palm struck out, spiritual energy exploding!

Li Xun's face changed drastically: "Foundation Establishment stage?? Weren't you at the ninth level of Qi Refining?!"

"Not anymore."

Three years of seclusion, one hundred and fifty Foundation Establishment pills, he had finally broken through!

The spiritual pressure of the early Foundation Establishment stage was suffocating Li Xun.

"Impossible!!! How could you...!"

Too late.

The second palm had already arrived.
```

## Advanced Self-Check System

### Three-Level Self-Check Method

#### Level 1: Basic Self-Check (Per Paragraph)
- [ ] Are there abstract times/characters/quantities?
- [ ] Is the punctuation too neat?
- [ ] Is the paragraph length too uniform?

#### Level 2: Dimensional Self-Check (Per Section)
- [ ] Text: Does it match the benchmark style?
- [ ] Punctuation: Are there emotional changes?
- [ ] Layout: Are 30-50% of paragraphs single sentences?
- [ ] Concretization: Are key plots concrete?

#### Level 3: Overall Self-Check (Per Chapter)
- [ ] Have all four layers of the strategy been applied?
- [ ] Are there any "AI-flavored" paragraphs?
- [ ] Is there a change in pacing (fast/slow)?
- [ ] Is the information density imbalanced (key vs. transition)?

### Quick Diagnosis Method

**If your text meets any 3 of the following, it may have AI flavor**:
1. ⚠️ Vague expressions for time/characters/quantities are common.
2. ⚠️ Punctuation is neat, no consecutive punctuation marks.
3. ⚠️ Paragraph length difference is <30%.
4. ⚠️ Single-sentence paragraphs are <20%.
5. ⚠️ No colloquial expressions.
6. ⚠️ Similes use "as if," "like."
7. ⚠️ Contains AI high-frequency words like "pervade," "unique."
