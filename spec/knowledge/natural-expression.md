# Natural Expression Guide

Eliminate the AI flavor to make text sound more like human writing.

> **New Content**: This guide has been expanded into a four-dimensional feature analysis framework. See **Section 9: The Four-Dimensional Feature Comprehensive Framework** for details.

## 1. Naturalization at the Lexical Level

### Avoiding AI-Characteristic Vocabulary
**Typical AI Vocabulary (to avoid)**:
- Academic: therefore, however, admittedly, in fact, obviously
- Archaic: very, quite, also, thus, hence
- Formal: it is worth noting, it is not hard to find, it can be said
- Template-based: firstly, secondly, finally; on the one hand, on the other hand

**Natural Alternatives**:
- "therefore" → "so," "as a result," "then"
- "however" → "but," "yet," "though"
- "admittedly" → "indeed," "yes," "that's true"
- "it is worth noting" → get straight to the point, don't lead

### Humanizing Word Choice
**Controlling Word Density**:
- Idiom density: no more than 2-3 per 1000 words
- Formal vocabulary: use colloquial alternatives whenever possible
- Jargon: avoid unless necessary; if used, explain

**Naturalness of Word Repetition**:
- Allow moderate repetition of keywords (a human trait)
- Don't deliberately avoid repetition by using synonyms (an AI trait)
- Use pronouns naturally, not excessively

### Dialect and Internet Slang
**Use moderately to add realism**:
- Regional words: use reasonably based on the character's background
- Internet slang: be mindful of timeliness and appropriate context
- Colloquial contractions: use them where possible (e.g., "gonna" for "going to")

## 2. Naturalization at the Syntactic Level

### Natural Variation in Sentence Length
**Avoid uniform distribution**:
- AI tendency: uniform distribution of 15-20 words per sentence
- Natural pattern: a mix of long and short, with length influenced by emotion
  - Tense moments: more short sentences, 5-8 words
  - Narrative: medium-length sentences, 15-25 words
  - Explanations: long sentences, 25-35 words

### Use of Incomplete Sentences
**Adds a colloquial feel**:
- Omitting the subject: "Feels a bit off."
- Omitting the predicate: "This whole thing... never mind."
- Interrupted sentences: "If only I could—no, better not to think about it."
- Inverted sentences: "Never thought, this would happen."

### Colloquial Features
**Interjections and Additions**:
- Flexible placement: "He, well, he's a bit strange."
- Spontaneous additions: "Bought three—no, four apples."
- Self-correction: "Yesterday, oh wait, the day before yesterday."

**Natural Use of Particles**:
- Sentence initial: uh, oh, hey, huh, ah
- Sentence medial: like, you know, right
- Sentence final: yeah, though, I guess

## 3. Naturalization at the Paragraph Level

### Realistic Portrayal of Shifting Thoughts
**Non-linear Associations**:
- Sudden recall: "Speaking of which, that reminds me..."
- Topic drift: naturally transitioning from A to a seemingly unrelated B
- Returning to the topic: "Where were we? Oh, right..."

### Variation in Information Density
**Avoid uniform information distribution**:
- Dense paragraphs: key plot points, important dialogue
- Sparse paragraphs: transitions, atmosphere building
- White space paragraphs: pure dialogue, pure action

### Humanizing Paragraph Rhythm
**Emotion influencing structure**:
- Agitated: short paragraphs, fast pace
- Calm: long paragraphs, slow pace
- Thoughtful: fragmented, many ellipses

## 4. Cognitive Simulation Strategy

### The Imperfection of Memory
**Human memory characteristics**:
- Vague details: "I think it was Tuesday, or maybe Wednesday"
- Jumbled order: "First, we went to... no, wait, first we..."
- Selective memory: remembers important things clearly, forgets trivial matters

### The Selectivity of Attention
**Limitations of perspective**:
- Noticing only some details
- Ignoring background information
- Subjective interpretation bias

### Hesitation in Expression
**Reflecting the thought process**:
- Uncertainty: "It should be... right?"
- Speculation: "I guess," "probably," "maybe"
- Correction: "No, wait, it should be..."

## 5. Flaw Implantation Technique

### Controlled Imperfection
**Types and frequency of errors**:
- Typos: 1 per 2000 words (e.g., mixing up "their," "there," "they're")
- Punctuation errors: 1 per 1000 words
- Grammatical flaws: 1 per 3000 words

### Casual Punctuation
**Realistic punctuation habits**:
- Ellipses: ... (3 dots), ... (periods), ...... (6 dots)
- Comma splices: using a comma where a period should be
- Exclamation points: using multiple in a row when excited!!

### Non-standard Formatting
**Personalized layout**:
- Uneven paragraph lengths
- Occasionally forgetting to start a new paragraph
- Inconsistent dialogue punctuation

## 6. Personality Marker System

### Establishing Unique Identifiers
**Personal fingerprint**:
- Preference for specific words
- Fixed sentence patterns
- Habitual expressions

### Maintaining a Consistent Style
**Features that run through the entire text**:
- Consistent narrative perspective
- Stable language style
- Coherent emotional tone

### Micro-variations within Macro-stability
**Dynamic balance**:
- Local variations (influenced by emotion)
- Overall consistency (personal style)
- Gradual development (as the plot deepens)

## 7. Practical Application Guide

### Detection and Adjustment
**Self-check standards**:
1.  Read-aloud test: Does it sound natural and smooth?
2.  Word frequency analysis: Is there a cluster of AI-characteristic words?
3.  Sentence length distribution: Is it too uniform?
4.  Information density: Is the amount of information in each paragraph roughly the same?

### Direction for Revision
**Techniques for reducing AI flavor**:
1.  Break up the perfect structure
2.  Add personalized details
3.  Create moderate chaos
4.  Retain reasonable flaws

### Finding the Right Balance
**Things to note**:
- Flaws should not hinder understanding
- Personality should not be overly eccentric
- Natural does not mean sloppy
- Colloquialism should be context-appropriate

## 8. Scene-based Application

### Dialogue Scenes
- Interruptions and overlaps
- Unfinished sentences
- Non-sequiturs
- Emotional expressions

### Narrative Scenes
- Limited perspective
- Subjective tone
- Selective detail
- Pacing variations

### Descriptive Scenes
- Sensory focus
- Impressionistic descriptions
- Omitting the secondary
- Highlighting key features

### Internal Monologues
- Shifting thoughts
- Self-dialogue
- Emotional fluctuations
- Internal conflict

## 9. The Four-Dimensional Feature Comprehensive Framework ⭐

### Core Philosophy

Human writing is not just about vocabulary and syntax, but also about **punctuation, layout, and special expressions**. To completely remove the AI flavor, all four dimensions must work together.

### The Four-Dimensional Analysis Framework

#### Dimension 1: Textual Features
- Vocabulary preference (Sections 1 & 2 of this guide)
- Syntactic structure (Sections 2 & 3 of this guide)
- Rhetorical devices
- Language style

**Self-Check Questions**:
- [ ] Have AI-characteristic words been avoided?
- [ ] Is word repetition natural?
- [ ] Are there personalized vocabulary habits?

#### Dimension 2: Sentence Structure Features
- Length variation (Section 2 of this guide)
- Incomplete sentences (Section 2 of this guide)
- Colloquial features (Section 2 of this guide)
- Paragraph rhythm (Section 3 of this guide)

**Self-Check Questions**:
- [ ] Do sentence lengths vary effectively?
- [ ] Are there incomplete sentence structures?
- [ ] Is the dialogue colloquial?

#### Dimension 3: Punctuation Habits ⭐ (Key Dimension)

**Core Features**:
- Varied ellipsis styles (..., ......, ... (periods))
- Emotional punctuation (multiple exclamation points, multiple question marks)
- Punctuation "errors" (dialect, habits)
- Punctuation rhythm (dense when tense, regular when calm)

**Self-Check Questions**:
- [ ] Is only one style of ellipsis used? (AI tendency)
- [ ] Does punctuation change with emotional excitement?
- [ ] Is the punctuation too neat?
- [ ] Are there emotional punctuation combinations? (!!, ??, ?!)

**Detailed Guide**: `spec/knowledge/punctuation-personality.md`

#### Dimension 4: Layout and Expression ⭐ (Key Dimension)

**Paragraph Structure**:
- Percentage of single-sentence paragraphs: 30-50% (key for anti-AI detection)
- Imbalanced paragraph lengths (from 3 words to 200 words)
- Use of blank lines (scene transitions, white space)

**Special Expressions**:
- Use of onomatopoeia
- Density of particles
- Colloquial contractions
- Incomplete sentence structures

**Self-Check Questions**:
- [ ] Do single-sentence paragraphs make up 30-50% of the text?
- [ ] Are paragraph lengths too uniform? (AI tendency)
- [ ] Are there incomplete sentence structures?
- [ ] Are particles used naturally?

### Example of Four-Dimensional Synergy

#### ❌ AI-like Expression (lacks four-dimensional features)

```
He was recently investigating a matter. Someone told him that it was very complicated and involved many people. He decided to continue his investigation.
```

**Problem Diagnosis**:
- Dimension 1: Abstract time/characters
- Dimension 2: Neat sentence structure
- Dimension 3: Regular punctuation
- Dimension 4: Uniform paragraphs

#### ✅ Natural Expression (complete with four-dimensional features)

```
Last Wednesday.

Old Wang found him, his voice low: "That thing... I found something out."

"What thing?"

"The fire on Yong'an Street." The old man looked around. "It wasn't an accident."

His heart tightened.

Yong'an Street... that was three years ago.

"Are you sure?"

"Absolutely."
```

**Four-Dimensional Feature Analysis**:
- **Dimension 1**: Specific time (Last Wednesday), specific characters (Old Wang, Yong'an Street)
- **Dimension 2**: Mix of long and short sentences, incomplete sentence ("What thing?")
- **Dimension 3**: Mixed use of ellipses (...), emotional punctuation (a single sentence paragraph after "His heart tightened.")
- **Dimension 4**: 8/11 = 73% single-sentence paragraphs, dialogue paragraphing, white space with blank lines

### Four-Dimensional Feature Extraction Tool

Use the `/book-style` command to automatically extract four-dimensional features from excellent works:

1.  **Textual Dimension**: High-frequency words, sentence structure preferences
2.  **Punctuation Dimension**: Ellipsis habits, exclamation point usage, emotional level
3.  **Layout Dimension**: Percentage of single-sentence paragraphs, paragraph length distribution
4.  **Expression Dimension**: Emojis, onomatopoeia, particles

The generated `style-reference.md` contains a complete four-dimensional analysis.
