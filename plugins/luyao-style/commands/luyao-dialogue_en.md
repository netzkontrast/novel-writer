User: /luyao-dialogue work Dialogue in the field during the wheat harvest season

AI:
【Wheat Harvest Season · In the Field】

Scene Setting:
Summer of 1982, the first wheat harvest after the implementation of the household responsibility system. The sun has just risen, and Tian Futang's family is in the field cutting wheat.

Characters:
- Tian Futang (Father, 50 years old)
- Lanhua (Mother, 45 years old)
- Fujun (Son, 22 years old)
- Xiaoyu (Daughter, 18 years old)

Dialogue:

Tian Futang (straightening his back, wiping the sweat with his sleeve):
"Fujun, how's the cutting on your side?"

Fujun (without looking up, continuing to cut):
"It's coming along, almost to the end of the row."

Tian Futang:
"The wheat has grown well this year. We should be able to get seven or eight hundred jin per mu. Our five mu of land should yield four thousand jin!"

Lanhua (cutting as she speaks):
"Don't count your chickens before they hatch. It's not in the granary yet. The old saying is right, the grain isn't yours until it's in the bin."

Tian Futang (laughing):
"Ah, you woman, always pouring cold water. This year, with the household responsibility system, all the grain we harvest is our own. I can't be happier!"

Xiaoyu (looking up at the sun):
"Dad, the sun is already high. Let's take a break, have a drink of water, and then continue."

Tian Futang:
"No break! Let's cut a bit more before the sun gets too strong. The wheat won't wait. We lose a little more every day we're late."

Fujun (interjecting):
"The radio said it might rain the day after tomorrow. We have to rush the harvest."

Lanhua:
"Then we can't rest. Xiaoyu, bring the water kettle over. Let everyone have a drink, and then we'll continue."

Xiaoyu (handing over the water kettle):
"Give it to Dad first. He's done the most."

Tian Futang (taking the water kettle, gulping it down):
"Good! I've got my strength back! Fujun, you come have a drink too."

Fujun (walking over, drinking water):
"Dad, I was thinking, after the wheat is harvested and we've kept enough for ourselves, could we sell the rest and buy a walking tractor?"

Tian Futang (his eyes lighting up):
"A walking tractor? That's a big purchase! It'll cost two or three thousand yuan!"

Fujun:
"I asked around. There's a used one at the county agricultural machinery station for one thousand eight hundred yuan. If we sell the grain and borrow a little, we should have enough."

Lanhua (worried):
"Borrow money? That's no joke. What if..."

Tian Futang (interrupting):
"Woman, Fujun is right! Now that we have the household responsibility system, we have to think big and act boldly. With a tractor, plowing, sowing, harvesting, everything will be easier."

Xiaoyu (excited):
"Are we really going to buy a tractor? Then our family will be the first in the village!"

Lanhua (sighing):
"You and your father can decide. It's not like my opinion counts anyway."

Tian Futang (firmly):
"It's settled then! As soon as the wheat is harvested, we'll go to the county to look at the tractor. We farmers need to mechanize too!"

### A Moment of Parting
```
User: /luyao-dialogue parting A son leaving home for the first time to work

AI:
【Seeing Him Off at the Station】

Time: Early spring of 1985
Location: The county bus station

Characters:
- Sun Shaoping (24 years old, about to go to the coal mine to work)
- Mother (52 years old)
- Sister Lanxiang (20 years old)

Mother (stuffing a cloth bag into Shaoping's hand):
"There are a dozen or so steamed buns in here. Eat them on the way if you get hungry. There's also a piece of pickled vegetable. Don't be reluctant to eat it. No one will take care of you when you're away from home."

Shaoping (taking the bag, his voice a little choked up):
"I know, Mom. You and Dad take care of yourselves."

Mother (her eyes red, but holding back her tears):
"When you get there, don't argue with people, don't cause trouble. It's okay if the work is hard, but be careful. The mine is dangerous."

Lanxiang (handing Shaoping a small cloth bag):
"Brother, these are the insoles I made for you, two pairs. It's damp in the mine, so it's good to have a few extra pairs to change into."

Shaoping (patting his sister's head):
"Lanxiang is so sensible now. You study hard at home and don't let Mom worry."

Mother:
"Write a letter home once a month to let us know you're safe. Don't skimp on the postage."

Shaoping:
"I'll definitely write. Mom, when I get paid, I'll send my first month's wages home."

Mother (waving her hand hurriedly):
"No need! You keep it. You need money for everything when you're away. We're doing fine at home."

The driver (shouting loudly):
"To Tongchuan, get on the bus! We're leaving now!"

Shaoping (turning to leave, then looking back):
"Mom, you go back. Don't see me off any further."

Mother (finally unable to hold back, tears streaming down her face):
"I'll watch you go. On the road... be careful on the road."

Lanxiang (holding her mother):
"Mom, Brother will take care of himself. Brother, you should get on the bus."

Shaoping (before getting on the bus, his last words):
"Mom, I'm leaving! Take care of yourself!"
