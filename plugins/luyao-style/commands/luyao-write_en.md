Chapter Three: The Wheat is Ripe

The wheat harvest of 1982 came a little earlier than in previous years.

Sun Shaoping stood at the edge of his family's wheat field, looking at the golden expanse, a indescribable feeling welling up in his heart. This was the first wheat harvest after the implementation of the household responsibility system, and it was also the first time his family was harvesting wheat for themselves.

The sun had just shown its face from the eastern mountain ridge, and dew still hung on the ears of wheat, glittering like crushed diamonds in the morning sun. Shaoping took a deep breath; the air was full of the fragrance of ripe wheat, mixed with the smell of the earth.

"Shaoping, what are you spacing out for! Get to it!"

His father's voice came from the other side of the field. The old man had already bent down and started to swing his sickle. The sound of "kach, kach" echoed in the morning fields, like an ancient folk song.

Shaoping quickly picked up his sickle. The blade had been sharpened just last night and was sharp enough to cut iron like mud. He bent down, gathered a handful of wheat with his left hand, and with a pull of the sickle in his right hand close to the ground, the wheat fell neatly.

Sweat soon soaked through his coarse cloth shirt. But Shaoping was happy in his heart—this wheat was his family's, every single grain. No longer did he have to watch the team leader's face, no longer did he have to worry about work points.

Lanhua brought over some mung bean soup. The bowl was made of coarse porcelain, and a few mint leaves floated on the surface of the soup.

"Drink it slowly, it's still hot," she said, wiping the sweat from her forehead with her sleeve.

Shaoping took the bowl and drank it down to the last drop. The mung bean soup was both sweet and cool, instantly quenching the fire in his heart. He looked at his sister's face, reddened by the sun, and suddenly felt that although life was still hard, at least there was something to look forward to...

Chapter Seven: The City's Sun

In the spring of 1985, Tian Fujun set foot in the provincial capital's train station for the first time.

The crowd surged from all directions like a flood. He was squeezed in the middle, almost unable to breathe. He held on tightly to the snakeskin bag in his hand, which contained a dozen or so steamed buns his mother had made, and a change of clothes.

After leaving the train station, the hustle and bustle of the city hit him in the face. The sound of car horns, the shouts of vendors, the pop songs from the radio, all mixed together, making this young man who grew up on the loess land feel dizzy.

He stood for a long time at the entrance of the talent market, watching the well-dressed city people coming and going, his own blue cloth shirt seeming particularly out of place. Several times, he wanted to turn and leave, but the thought of his father's expectant eyes when he left made him stay.

"Young man, looking for a job?"

A middle-aged man with glasses came over. Fujun nodded, his voice trembling slightly: "Yes... yes."

"Do you have any special skills?"

Fujun thought for a moment: "I... I have strength, I can do any kind of work."

The middle-aged man smiled: "Strength alone is not enough. The city needs skilled workers now. Can you read?"

"High school graduate." As he said this, Fujun puffed out his chest. In his village, a high school graduate was considered an educated person.

### Mining Life

User: /luyao-write mining A day in the life of a coal miner

AI:
Chapter Twelve: Black Gold

At four in the morning, Wang Manyin woke up before the alarm clock rang.

This was a habit he had developed over many years. When you work eight hundred meters underground, you have to be very conscious of the time. He got up quietly, afraid of waking his wife and child who were still sound asleep.

It was still dark outside, with only the lights of the mining area twinkling in the distance. Manyin put on his work clothes, a set of washed-out blue cloth garments with coal stains that couldn't be washed out. He scooped a ladle of cold water from the water vat at the door and washed his face with a splash, which instantly woke him up.

At the entrance of the mine shaft, the other workers arrived one after another. No one said much; they silently put on their safety helmets and checked their miner's lamps.

"Going down!" the foreman shouted, and everyone lined up and walked into the dark mine entrance.

As the cage descended, his ears were ringing. Manyin closed his eyes and silently recited what his wife had said last night: "Be careful, come back safely."
