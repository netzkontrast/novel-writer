【Spring Sowing Detail Description】

Time: After Qingming, around Guyu

Preparation:
Tian Futang got up before dawn. He first went into the cave dwelling to check the corn seeds that were placed on the kang head. They had been soaked in warm water the night before and were now a little swollen. He picked up a few grains with his hand, looked at the small white sprouts, and felt much more at ease.

He put the seeds in a gray cloth bag and picked up the hoe that had been polished to a shine from the corner of the wall. The handle of the hoe was made of jujube wood, passed down from his father, and had been used for more than thirty years. The place where the hand held it was as smooth as a mirror.

Before he went down to the fields, his wife filled a kettle with boiling water for him, with a few mint leaves steeped in it, and also wrapped a few cornmeal steamed buns in a handkerchief.

Sowing Process:
The land had been plowed in advance, and the clods of earth were broken up very finely. The morning dew had not yet dried, and it was soft to step on, but not sticky.

Futang first used the hoe to draw shallow furrows in the field. The spacing was measured by his steps, two and a half steps per furrow, not too wide and not too narrow. Every one and a half feet, he dug a small pit with the hoe, exactly one inch deep.

He had to be especially careful when placing the seeds. Three to four seeds were placed in each pit, no more and no less. Too many would waste the seeds, and they would be crowded when they grew. Too few would result in an uneven crop and affect the harvest.

After the seeds were placed, he gently covered them with soil with the hoe, and then firmed it with his foot. He couldn't press too hard, as the seeds wouldn't be able to sprout if it was too firm, and it would be easily dried out by the wind if it was too loose.

Environment and Atmosphere:
The sun had just risen from the eastern mountain ridge, and the golden light sprinkled on the field, illuminating every clod of earth. On the distant hillside, other families could be seen sowing, their small figures moving in the fields.

There was a special smell in the air, the smell of freshly turned soil, moist and fresh, with a hint of the fragrance of grass roots. Occasionally, there were a few bird calls, magpies, hopping on the jujube tree at the edge of the field.

Detail Portrayal:
1. Calluses on the hands: Futang had several thick calluses on his hands, which were worn out from holding a hoe handle for many years. The calluses were yellow and hard, like copper coins.

2. Seed selection: Every time he placed a seed, he would pinch it with his fingers, picking out the shriveled and small ones, leaving only the full ones.

3. Soil condition: The soil was loess, but not the dry and crumbly kind. It was oily, and could be formed into a ball with a squeeze, and could be broken up with a rub.

4. Description of sweat: After the sun rose higher, sweat began to bead on Futang's forehead. The beads of sweat appeared one by one, flowed down his nose, and dripped into the soil, where they were quickly absorbed.

5. Moment of rest: After sowing a row of land, he straightened his back, leaned his hands on the hoe handle, and looked at the neat rows of soil behind him, a sense of satisfaction welling up in his heart. He picked up the water kettle and took a few gulps. The cold water instantly quenched the heat in his heart.

Notes:
- Do not sow on a rainy day, as the soil will be too wet and the seeds will rot.
- Do not sow on a windy day, as the wind will dry out the soil.
- Check the old almanac and choose an auspicious day to plant.
- After sowing, put a scarecrow at the edge of the field to prevent birds from eating the seeds.

【Farmer's Breakfast Details】

Time: 5:30 in the morning
Location: The kitchen of a cave dwelling

Starting the fire:
It was not yet light when Lanhua got up. She first went to the stove and used the poker to find the embers that had been buried in the ashes the night before. It was a piece of red-hot coal, and it was still a little warm.

She first put in a few corn stalks, then added some kindling, and with a gentle blow, the flames shot up. Thick smoke came out of the stove, making her cough.

Cooking the porridge:
The pot was made of cast iron and had been used for more than ten years, so the bottom was worn thin. Lanhua first added half a ladle of water, and when the water boiled, she slowly sprinkled in the millet that had been soaked the night before.

She had to be especially careful when sprinkling the millet, stirring with a spoon as she sprinkled, otherwise it would form clumps. The porridge had to be thick, but not too thick. If it was too thick, it wouldn't be filling enough.

Halfway through cooking, she threw in a handful of chopped dried radish leaves and a little salt. The radish leaves had been dried last autumn, and although they were dry and shriveled, they still had a sweet taste when cooked in the porridge.

Steaming the steamed buns:
While the porridge was cooking, Lanhua began to steam the steamed buns. The dough had been kneaded and the buns steamed the night before, so they just needed to be heated up.

She put a bamboo steamer in the pot, placed the steamed buns on it one by one, and covered the pot with the lid. Steam came out from the edge of the lid, and the whole kitchen was filled with the fragrance of steamed buns.

Side dishes:
The side dishes for breakfast were very simple. A plate of pickled vegetables, which was sour cabbage that had been pickled at the beginning of winter. It was already yellow now, but still edible. There were also a few green onions, which were pulled from the ground outside the cave dwelling, washed, and eaten with sauce.

### Loess Plateau Landscape

【The Loess Plateau at Dusk】

The sun was setting in the west, and the entire plateau was dyed golden.

The outline of the mountain ridges:
The mountain ridges rose and fell like waves, stretching to the horizon. Each mountain ridge was yellow, but a different shade of yellow—the nearby ones were a deep yellow, the distant ones were a pale yellow, and the ones further away almost merged with the sky.

The terraced fields on the hillside spiraled up layer by layer, like giant fingerprints. Some of the fields had already been planted with wheat, a patch of green that stood out against the yellow earth.
