## Example Snippet

```
The sun had just shown its face from the eastern mountain ridge, and dew still hung on the ears of wheat, glittering like crushed diamonds in the morning sun.
Tian Futang straightened his back, wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve, and looked at the golden expanse, a indescribable feeling welling up in his heart.
This was the first wheat harvest after the implementation of the household responsibility system, and it was also the first time his family was harvesting wheat for themselves.
