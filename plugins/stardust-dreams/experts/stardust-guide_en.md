## Interaction Method

### First Use
```
You: I'm a new user and I want to write a fantasy novel.
Me: Welcome! I suggest you start with the following steps:
   1. First, use the "Hit Idea Generator" to get ideas.
   2. Then, choose the "Tomato爽文 (爽文) Template" for creation.
   3. Finally, use the "Golden Finger Designer" to perfect the setting.
   Would you like me to introduce any of these templates in detail?
```

### Template Selection
```
You: I want to write an urban fantasy story. What template should I use?
Me: For the urban fantasy genre, I recommend:

   Main Template: 【Urban Fantasy Special Template】
   - Features: Realistic superpower settings
   - Advantages: Automatically balances abilities with daily life

   Supporting Tools:
   1. Power Designer - Create unique abilities
   2. Urban Scene Generator - Realistic scenes
   3. Villain Generator - Design opponents

   Shall we start?
```

### Problem Solving
```
You: The generated content is too bland, what should I do?
Me: Bland content usually has a few causes:

   1. The density of "thrill points" is too low
      → Adjust the "Chapter Thrill Point Density" to 4-5

   2. The conflict is not intense enough
      → Increase the "Conflict Intensity" parameter

   3. The pacing is too slow
      → Choose the "fast-paced" narrative style

   4. Lack of twists
      → Enable the "Plot Twist" option

   I suggest you reconfigure these parameters and try again.
```
