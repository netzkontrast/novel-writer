Chapter 1: Blood Stains Weiyang

In the sixth year of Yonghui, Chang'an.

At the third watch of the Zi hour, a drop of blood fell silently on the stone steps outside the Hanyuan Hall, glowing with a strange dark red in the moonlight.

Li Chunfeng stopped. His eyes, which could see through the secrets of heaven, narrowed slightly. As the Director of the Imperial Observatory of the Great Tang, he should have been observing the stars at the observatory, but tonight's celestial phenomena forced him to enter the palace at the risk of his life. The Ziwei star was dim, the Emperor star was wavering, and what shocked him the most was that a guest star that should not have appeared was slowly approaching the Emperor's seat.

"Someone is going to assassinate the emperor." The thought had just flashed through his mind when a suppressed groan came from a distance.

Chapter 17: The Three Kingdoms Game

In the thirteenth year of Jian'an, twenty miles outside Xuchang city, in the abandoned Qingyun Temple.

Three lamps, three faces, three figures that could change the pattern of the world.

Cao Cao's strategist, Guo Jia, sat in the east. He coughed twice, and crimson blood blossomed on his silk handkerchief. Everyone knew that this strategist, known as the "ghost talent," was not long for this world, but no one dared to underestimate the final layout of a dying man.

In the south, Zhou Yu stood with his hands behind his back. At thirty-two, he was in his prime, and the light in his eyes was as deep and unfathomable as the Yangtze River. As Sun Quan's right-hand man, his appearance tonight was a dangerous signal in itself.

The west seat was empty for a moment before someone leisurely took a seat. The newcomer was dressed in a green robe, with a feather fan and a silk scarf, and it was none other than Liu Bei's military advisor, Zhuge Liang. At twenty-seven, the Crouching Dragon had only been out of his thatched cottage for a year, but he had already stirred up half the world.

"Why have the three of you gathered here tonight?" Guo Jia was the first to speak, his voice weak but with a hidden edge.

### Creating a Battle Scene

User: /shizhangyu-write battle The last night of the Battle of Guandu

AI:
Chapter 23: The Bloody Night of Guandu

In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jian'an, at Guandu.

The war drums were like thunder, and a blood moon hung in the sky.

In Yuan Shao's camp, an army of 700,000 had already assembled. This was an army gathered with the full strength of the four provinces of Hebei. Just looking at the endless line of tents was enough to make any enemy tremble with fear.

"Tonight is the night of Cao Aman's death!" Yuan Shao stood on the command platform, his originally refined face now full of ferocity. Three months of confrontation, the consumption of 100,000 shi of grain, and the betrayal of Xu You had all made this overlord of Hebei lose his former composure.

At this moment, a commotion came from outside the central tent.

"Report! There's a fire in the direction of Wuchao!"

These six words were like a bolt from the blue, instantly turning Yuan Shao's face pale. Wuchao was the vital place where he stored his grain, and it held enough military supplies to support his 700,000-strong army for a month!
