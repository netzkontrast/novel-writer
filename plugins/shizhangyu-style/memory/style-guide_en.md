# Shi Zhangyu Style Creation Guide

## Core Philosophy

The essence of the Shi Zhangyu style is to create epic and literary long-form masterpieces using a grand historical background as the stage, profound power struggles as the main plotline, and a vivid cast of characters as the soul.

## Creation Principles

### First Principle: Grand but Not Empty

- **Sense of the Times**: Every story must be rooted in a specific historical context.
- **Sense of Reality**: Details are meticulously researched, and the logic is rigorous and can withstand scrutiny.
- **Sense of Epic**: The interweaving and collision of individual destiny and the tide of the times.
- **Sense of Weight**: The text carries the weight of history and the depth of human nature.

### Second Principle: Power Struggles but Not Dark

- **Game of Wits**: Showcases the ultimate contest of human intelligence.
- **Conflict of Stances**: There is no absolute good or evil, only different standpoints.
- **The Brilliance of Human Nature**: Even in power struggles, there is the warmth of humanity.
- **Pursuit of Values**: Every character has their own pursuits and beliefs.

### Third Principle: Complex but Not Chaotic

- **Clear Structure**: The main plotline is clear, and the subplots are orderly.
- **Rigorous Logic**: The cause-and-effect relationships are clear, and the development is reasonable.
- **Pacing Control**: The rhythm is well-controlled, with rising and falling action and climaxes.
- **Exquisite Foreshadowing**: Naturally planted and surprisingly revealed.

## Narrative Techniques

### 1. Opening Techniques

#### Strong Hook Design
- The first sentence must be captivating.
- Establish suspense or conflict within the first 100 words.
- Show the scope of the story within the first 500 words.
- Make the reader unable to stop reading within the first 1000 words.

#### Example Opening
```
In the sixth year of Yonghui, Chang'an, at the Zi hour.
A drop of blood fell silently on the steps of the Hanyuan Hall.
No one noticed this detail, except for Li Chunfeng.
As the Director of the Imperial Observatory of the Great Tang, he knew that this drop of blood meant that a turning point for a dynasty had arrived.
```

### 2. Scene Construction

#### Three Layers of Environmental Description
1. **Physical Layer**: Specific environmental details.
2. **Atmospheric Layer**: The emotions created by the environment.
3. **Symbolic Layer**: The metaphorical meaning of the environment.

#### Example Scene
```
Inside the council hall, the candlelight flickered (physical).
Each person's face looked strange and unpredictable in the flickering light and shadow (atmosphere).
Just like the fate of this dynasty, swaying in the wind and rain, it was unknown when it would be extinguished (symbolic).
```

### 3. Character Creation

#### Five Dimensions of a Three-dimensional Character
1. **External Image**: A feature that makes them memorable at a glance.
2. **Language Style**: A unique way of speaking.
3. **Behavioral Pattern**: A logic of action that is consistent with their personality.
4. **Inner World**: Complex psychological activities.
5. **Growth Trajectory**: Dynamic personality development.

#### Character Introduction Formula
```
Physical Appearance + Signature Action + Unique Temperament + Others' Reactions = Deep Impression
```

### 4. The Art of Dialogue

#### Four Elements of Power Struggle Dialogue
1. **Surface Meaning**: The literal meaning.
2. **Deep Meaning**: What is truly being expressed.
3. **Probing Purpose**: The information one wants to obtain.
4. **Game Result**: The change in the situation after the dialogue.

#### Dialogue Example
```
"I hear your son has been frequenting the East Market recently?" (Surface: Small talk)
"Young people need to see the world." (Deep: I know you're watching me)
"The East Market is a mixed bag, one must be careful." (Probing: Threat)
"Thank you for your concern, I will pass it on to my son." (Game: Unmoved)
```

### 5. Plot Advancement

#### The Three-Line Method
- **Main Line**: The core conflict and goal.
- **Secondary Line**: Complements and enriches the main line.
- **Hidden Line**: A hidden truth or conspiracy.

#### Pacing Control
```
Buildup (3) → Development (5) → Climax (8) → Respite (2) → Rising Action (7) → Explosion (10)
```

### 6. Foreshadowing Techniques

#### Three Principles of Foreshadowing
1. **Naturalness Principle**: Integrated into the narrative, not abrupt.
2. **Necessity Principle**: Every instance of foreshadowing must have a purpose.
3. **Surprise Principle**: The reveal is unexpected but logical.

#### Foreshadowing Types and Examples
- **Object Foreshadowing**: A seemingly ordinary jade pendant → A royal token.
- **Dialogue Foreshadowing**: "He's still alive" → A key character is not dead.
- **Behavioral Foreshadowing**: Someone's habitual action → Identity is exposed.
- **Environmental Foreshadowing**: An overlooked secret passage → An escape route.

## Language Style

### Narrative Language

#### Basic Requirements

#### Language Style for Different Scenes
- **Court**: Solemn and elegant, with hidden meanings.
- **Battlefield**: Passionate and powerful, heroic and bold.

## Common Problems and Solutions

**Solution**: Strengthen personalized language and add signature details.

### Problem 3: The pacing is slow and long-winded.
**Solution**: Cut unnecessary descriptions and increase the density of conflict.

### Problem 4: The foreshadowing is revealed awkwardly.
**Solution**: Hint multiple times in advance, so the reveal is natural.

### Problem 5: It's difficult to complete 20,000 words.
**Solution**: Advance multiple plotlines, enrich the details, and intensify the conflict.

## Creation Mentality

1. **Have the big picture in mind**: Have a grand vision before writing the details.
2. **Proceed step by step**: Every step must be solid.
3. **Leave room for maneuver**: Don't speak in absolutes or block off all paths.
4. **See the big in the small**: Show the grand through details.
5. **Combine the real and the虛**: Use both explicit writing and leaving things unsaid.
6. **Balance motion and stillness**: Alternate between intense and calm scenes.
7. **Meaning beyond the words**: The most brilliant parts are outside the text.

When the reader closes the book, they not only remember the exciting story, but also feel:
- The weight of the era
- The complexity of human nature
- The light of wisdom
- The unpredictability of fate
