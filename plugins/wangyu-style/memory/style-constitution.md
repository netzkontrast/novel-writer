# Wang Yu Style Creation Specification

## Core Philosophy

This specification is based on the creative style of Wang Yu (representative works: "A Record of a Mortal's Journey to Immortality," "The Gate of Xuan World"), providing systematic style guidance for creators.

## Narrative Principles

### Objectivity Principle
- Maintain the objectivity of the third-person omniscient perspective.
- Avoid excessive emotional coloring and subjective judgments.
- Show the characters' inner world through actions and details.

### Pacing Control
- A good balance of tension and relaxation, avoiding constant tension or looseness.
- Detail important plots, and summarize transitional plots.
- Battle scenes focus on strategy, rather than a simple clash of power.

## World-building Construction

### Power System
Strictly follow the eight-level realm division:
1. Qi Condensation (Levels 1-9)
2. Foundation Establishment (Early, Mid, Late)
3. Core Formation (Early, Mid, Late)
4. Nascent Soul (Early, Mid, Late)
5. Spirit Transformation (Early, Mid, Late)
6. Void Refinement (Early, Mid, Late)
7. Body Integration (Early, Mid, Late)
8. Mahayana (Early, Mid, Late)

### Resource System
The four major resource categories must reflect scarcity:
- **Spirit Stones**: The basis for cultivation and trade.
- **Pills**: The key to breakthroughs and recovery.
- **Magical Artifacts**: An important component of combat power.
- **Cultivation Techniques**: The determining factor of cultivation speed.

## Character Creation Guidelines

### Protagonist Traits
- **Cautious**: Thinks three times before acting, does not take risks easily.
- **Pragmatic**: Values practical benefits, does not pursue a false reputation.
- **Patient**: Able to bend and stretch, knows when to lie low.
- **Decisive**: Does not hesitate when an opportunity arises.

### Supporting Character Design
- Every supporting character has their own goals and motivations.
- There is no absolute good or evil, only different standpoints.
- Even enemies have their understandable side.

## Plot Design

### Suspense Setting
- At least one point of suspense in each chapter.
- Long-term foreshadowing spans multiple chapters.
- The resolution of suspense should be reasonable and unexpected.

### Conflict Design
- External conflict: treasure hunting, pursuit, sect struggles.
- Internal conflict: tests of the Dao heart, ideological conflicts.
- Conflict of interest: resource competition, competition for opportunities.

## Language Style

### Wording Specification
- Use professional cultivation terminology.
- Avoid modern internet slang.
- Maintain an elegant but not obscure style.

### Description Requirements
- Environmental descriptions should be picturesque.
- Action descriptions should be precise and specific.
- Dialogue should be consistent with the character's identity.

## Creation Taboos

### Must be Avoided
1. The protagonist's plot armor is too strong, easily obtaining opportunities.
2. The power system collapses, and fighting above one's level is too simple.
3. The characters' intelligence drops, and they behave unreasonably.
4. Resources are too easy to obtain, losing their scarcity.
5. The plot develops too quickly, lacking buildup.

### Handle with Caution
1. The romantic storyline should not be too prominent.
2. Humorous elements should be used in moderation.
3. Modern thinking should not be excessive.
4. Didactic content should be integrated into the plot.

## Quality Standards

### Excellent Chapter Standard
- Has a clear chapter goal.
- The plot advances reasonably.
- The characters' actions are logically self-consistent.
- Leaves appropriate suspense.
- The world-building description is substantial.

## Reference Examples

### Standard Opening
"The sky was getting dark, and there were few pedestrians on the official road outside Green Mountain City. A young man in a green shirt was walking unhurriedly towards the city gate. He looked no more than fifteen or sixteen years old, with an ordinary appearance, but his eyes were exceptionally bright."

### Standard Battle
"The two attacked at the same time, but both held back a third of their strength. In the cultivation world, preserving one's strength was often more important than going all out. Only when one was sure of a one-hit kill would they use their full strength."

### Standard Psychology
"On the surface, Han Li was calm, but in his heart, he was already calculating quickly. This Foundation Establishment Pill was worth thirty thousand spirit stones, but more importantly, it represented an opportunity to enter the inner sect."
