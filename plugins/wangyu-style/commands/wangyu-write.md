## Example Usage

### Creating a Chapter Opening
```
User: /wangyu-write opening The protagonist enters a market.
AI:
The bluestone-paved street was lined with shops of all kinds. Han Li lowered his bamboo hat, his calm gaze sweeping over the cultivators on the street.

Two at the early Foundation Establishment stage, thirteen at the Qi Condensation stage.

He withdrew his gaze without a change in expression, his steps unhurried as he walked forward. The location indicated by the fragmented map he had obtained in the Sunset Mountains three months ago was somewhere in this market. But before he found his target, he needed to get a feel for the situation here.

"Fellow Daoist, would you like to see the new second-tier spiritual herbs in our shop?" a middle-aged cultivator at the eighth level of Qi Condensation greeted him with a smile.

Han Li paused slightly and glanced at the man indifferently. "What's the price?"

"Honest to all, a thousand-year-old blood ginseng for only three thousand mid-grade spirit stones."

Three thousand mid-grade spirit stones were equivalent to three hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones. For a Qi Condensation cultivator, this was an astronomical sum. But Han Li knew that a true thousand-year-old blood ginseng was worth far more than that. This man before him probably had other intentions.

### Creating a Battle Scene
```
User: /wangyu-write battle A battle between Golden Core cultivators
AI:
Two streaks of light suddenly collided in mid-air.

"Boom!"

A green sword light and a crimson flame clashed violently, and the spiritual energy fluctuations spread out like ripples. The gravel on the ground was swept up by the shockwave and turned to dust.

The old man surnamed Chen's hand seals changed, and thirty-six green-edged swords whistled out, forming a sword formation in the air. Each flying sword exuded a sharp sword intent, and the runes on the sword's body flowed, indicating that they were all high-grade magical artifacts.

"Green Nether Sword Formation, go!"

The red-robed cultivator opposite him snorted coldly. With a flip of his hand, a palm-sized red shield grew with the wind, instantly turning into a ten-foot-tall flame giant shield. A phantom of a fire phoenix was faintly visible on the shield's surface, exuding an astonishingly high temperature.

"Clang, clang, clang—"

The flying swords struck the giant shield, making a sound of metal clashing. Each collision would stir up a large shower of sparks, but the giant shield did not move at all.

A glint flashed in the old man surnamed Chen's eyes, and his left hand quietly formed a seal. A faint silver light shot out from his sleeve, silently bypassing the giant shield and heading straight for the red-robed cultivator's brow.

This was his trump card—the Shadowless Needle.

### Describing a Cultivation Breakthrough
```
User: /wangyu-write breakthrough From the mid-Foundation Establishment to the late stage
AI:
In the secret chamber, Han Li sat cross-legged with three jade bottles in front of him.

The first jade bottle contained five Spirit Nurturing Pills, which could stabilize his realm; the second contained a Purple Sun Pill, which could increase the success rate of a breakthrough; and the third was the Heaven's Heart Dew that he had spent a great price to obtain, which could protect his heart meridian at a critical moment.

He took a deep breath and consumed all the Spirit Nurturing Pills.

The medicinal power slowly circulated through his meridians, nourishing his dantian like a trickling stream. Half an hour later, his aura was completely stable, and only then did he take out the Purple Sun Pill.

The pill melted in his mouth, and a scorching medicinal power instantly erupted. Han Li immediately circulated his cultivation technique, guiding this power to break through the bottleneck.

The barrier from the mid-Foundation Establishment to the late stage was like an invisible wall in front of him. Each impact would cause a tearing pain in his meridians.

The first time, he failed.
The second time, he still failed.
The third time...

Sweat slid down Han Li's cheeks, and his face grew paler. On the seventh impact, a soft "crack" sounded inside his body.

The bottleneck had loosened.
