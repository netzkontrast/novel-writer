└─────────────┴─────┴──────────────────────┘

Main Problems:
1. ❌ The battle description is too simple and lacks detail.
2. ❌ The characters' cultivation realms are not stated.
3. ❌ "Instantly defeating" is too easy.
4. ❌ Lacks a description of tactics and strategy.

Improvement Suggestions:
1. Add a specific realm description (e.g., "late Foundation Establishment").
2. Describe the sword technique and the circulation of true energy in detail.
3. Add a back-and-forth struggle to the battle.
4. Reflect the preciousness and consumption of the magical artifact.

Wang Yu Style Rewrite Example:
"Lin Ping took a deep breath, and the magical power of the late Foundation Establishment stage slowly circulated within his body. The green-edged sword in his hand was a high-grade magical artifact, and at this moment, the runes on the sword's body were faintly visible, exuding a faint cold light.

The black-robed cultivator opposite him was also at the late Foundation Establishment stage. Seeing this, he sneered and summoned a tortoise shell shield.

Lin Ping's gaze narrowed. This battle would probably not be so easy. He needed to end it quickly, otherwise, if he consumed too much magical power, the consequences would be dire. Thinking of this, he quietly crushed a second-tier spiritual talisman in his sleeve..."
